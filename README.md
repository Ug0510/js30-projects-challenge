# js30-projects-challenge

Welcome to my **JavaScript30** challenge repository! Over the next 30 days, I‚Äôll be building 30 projects in **Vanilla JavaScript** (no libraries, no frameworks) to master core JavaScript concepts and work with browser APIs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

Here are a few of the fun projects I‚Äôll be building:

- **JavaScript Drum Kit**
- **CSS & JS Clock**
- **Ajax Type Ahead**
- **Custom HTML5 Video Player**
- **Geolocation-based Speedometer**
- **Whack-A-Mole Game**
- and more!

Each day, I‚Äôll tackle a new challenge, focusing on:
- **JavaScript fundamentals**
- **DOM manipulation**
- **Hands-on experience with browser APIs**

## üìà Why This Challenge?

Real growth happens through **building**. By committing to this challenge, I‚Äôm pushing myself to:
- Strengthen my understanding of JavaScript
- Build real-world applications
- Explore new ideas and techniques
