# js30-projects-challenge

Welcome to my **JavaScript30** challenge repository! Over the next 30 days, I’ll be building 30 projects in **Vanilla JavaScript** (no libraries, no frameworks) to master core JavaScript concepts and work with browser APIs.

## 🛠️ Projects

Here are a few of the fun projects I’ll be building:

- **JavaScript Drum Kit**
- **CSS & JS Clock**
- **Ajax Type Ahead**
- **Custom HTML5 Video Player**
- **Geolocation-based Speedometer**
- **Whack-A-Mole Game**
- and more!

Each day, I’ll tackle a new challenge, focusing on:
- **JavaScript fundamentals**
- **DOM manipulation**
- **Hands-on experience with browser APIs**

## 📈 Why This Challenge?

Real growth happens through **building**. By committing to this challenge, I’m pushing myself to:
- Strengthen my understanding of JavaScript
